summary: Open source clone of Theme Hospital
description: 
  CorsixTH aims to re-implement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be 
  able to load the original game data files. This means that you will need
  a purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to
  use CorsixTH. After most of the original engine has been re-implemented
  in open source code, the project will serve as a base from which
  extensions and improvements to the original game can be made.
  We use graphics, sound and other data from the original game so one 
  of the following is required
    Original game CD from eBay etc. or your dusty bookshelf
    A download from GOG.com or Origin
